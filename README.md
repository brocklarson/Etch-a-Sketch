# Etch-a-Sketch

Etch-a-Sketch project for The Odin Project. This project imitates the Etch-A-Sketch toy and lets you hover your cursor in order to "draw" images on the Etch-A-Sketch tablet. You can draw in black, random colors, color of your choosing, or a greyscale option that progressively gets darker each pass. You can also erase specific pixels or shake the tablet to "clear" the drawing.

A focus for this project was DOM manipulation within javascript, including creating/removing html elements, using event listeners, adding css styles, etc. Another area of focus was learning how to handle the multiple potential inputs from different coloring option buttons and recognizing what was selected and carry out that function in an efficient manner.
