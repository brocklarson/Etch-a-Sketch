# Etch-a-Sketch

Etch-a-Sketch project for The Odin Project. A focus for this project was DOM manipulation within javascript, including creating/removing html elements, using event listeners, adding css styles, etc. Another area of focus was learning how to handle the multiple potential inputs from different coloring option buttons and recognizing what was selected and carry out that function in an efficient manner.
